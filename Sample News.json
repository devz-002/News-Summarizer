   Little else will draw attention at Tesla’s annual shareholder meeting on Thursday like the vote on Elon Musk’s 
   pay packet. Robyn Denholm, the electric-vehicle maker’s chair, argues that the deal—potentially worth around 
   $1trn and boosting Mr Musk’s stake from 16% to more than 25%—is vital to keep him focused on Tesla.
   To earn the full award, he would have to lift the company’s value from about $1.5trn to $8.5trn and
   meet ambitious targets, including for car deliveries, robotaxis and humanoid robots.
   Critics note that, because the payout comes in stages, some goals are far easier to achieve than others.
   Mr Musk and the board, whose independence is often questioned, are waging an energetic campaign to push the
   deal through. That may be enough to outweigh opposition from big institutional investors—including Norway’s 
   sovereign-wealth fund—and secure the backing of Tesla’s loyal retail shareholders."
